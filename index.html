    <h2 class = "center">Hi! I'm Daniel Ermel</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student with Thinkful learning how to become a web developer. I am located north of Chicago.</p>
    <p>Once a high school choir teacher, I am now aiming to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply my musical training and sense of artistry to everything I work with.</li>
      <li>Compose visual art in the form of your web page.</li>
      <li>Think outside the Bach's as much as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="#contact">Contact Me</a> with any inquiries!</p>

    <h2 class="center">About Daniel</h2>
    <p>After graduating college with a performance degree in Musical Theatre, my life has led me on a winding chase through puppeteering, vocal coaching, musical direction, working as a one-on-one in an elementary school, teaching in high school, and now I have arrived at web development. So while my path is a little less common, I'm excited to be entering a field that speaks to me on a mathematical and artistic level.
    </p>
    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, need a composer to help out with a piece of music, or want to talk about anything in between, please reach out! I'm excited to be able to apply both sides of my brain to any opportunity headed my way.</p>
